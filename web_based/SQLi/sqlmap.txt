OBSERVATIONS:!!!

When using sqlmap , only providing the url of the website or the url of the request , in most cases is not enough.
Try using either:
1)recording the request that you suspect is injectable in a .req file(done with burp suite) and feeding it to sqlmap
2)specify the --data paramater
.
.
Overall specificity is key when using a tool like this one 






Key Features of SQLMap:

    Database Fingerprinting: Identifies the type and version of the database.
    Data Extraction: Retrieves data such as tables, columns, and even the contents of the database.
    Privilege Escalation: Identifies and exploits different levels of database privileges.

simple case:

sqlmap -u http://hostname/ajax.php?action=login --data="username=abc&password=abc" -p username --batch
