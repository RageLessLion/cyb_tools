A DNS zone transfer is the process of copying contents of a DNS zone file from one DNS server to another.

AXFR -> full zone transfer (used when secondary server needs to completely sync with primary server)

IXFR -> incremental ( transfers only the changes : additions , deletions and modifications since the last change)

Security risks : potential access to IP addresses , network structure , services , etc..

Preventing : Restrict zone transfers to specific IP addresses + use TSIG (Transaction signature)

COMMAND ------->>>>>> dig @IP axfr domain_name
