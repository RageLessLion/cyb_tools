RageLessLion: how to make the status bar provided by tqdm to stay unmoved ( right now it's moving alongside 5 or 6 requests)

GitHub Copilot: To ensure the status bar provided by [`tqdm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fnapoleonsolo%2Fcyb_tools%2Fscripts%2Fpython%2Fdir_fuzzer.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%2240289db3-535d-4cd1-bef0-050d5bb303f9%22%5D "Go to definition") stays unmoved while updating the progress, you can use the [`tqdm.write`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fnapoleonsolo%2Fcyb_tools%2Fscripts%2Fpython%2Fdir_fuzzer.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%2240289db3-535d-4cd1-bef0-050d5bb303f9%22%5D "Go to definition") method to print the status of each request. This method ensures that the progress bar remains in place. Your current implementation already uses [`tqdm.write`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fnapoleonsolo%2Fcyb_tools%2Fscripts%2Fpython%2Fdir_fuzzer.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%2240289db3-535d-4cd1-bef0-050d5bb303f9%22%5D "Go to definition"), but you might need to ensure that the progress bar is updated correctly after each request.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Ensure [`tqdm.write`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fnapoleonsolo%2Fcyb_tools%2Fscripts%2Fpython%2Fdir_fuzzer.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%2240289db3-535d-4cd1-bef0-050d5bb303f9%22%5D "Go to definition") is used for printing request statuses.
2. Update the progress bar after each request.

Here's the updated code:

```python
import requests
import sys
import os
import concurrent.futures
import logging
from tqdm import tqdm

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename="dirbuster_errors.log", level=logging.ERROR)

# Custom headers
HEADERS = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DirBuster/1.0)"}

def make_request(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=5)
        return (url, response.status_code)
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        return (url, "Timeout")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Error for {url}: {e}")
        return (url, f"Error: {e}")

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: python3 path_finder.py <wordlist> <base_url>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    wordlist_path = sys.argv[1]
    base_url = sys.argv[2]

    if not os.path.isfile(wordlist_path):
        print(f"Error: File '{wordlist_path}' not found.")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    try:
        with open(wordlist_path, "r") as file:
            lines = [line.strip() for line in file if line.strip()]
        
        # Progress bar setup
        with tqdm(total=len(lines), desc="Scanning URLs") as pbar:
            with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
                futures = {executor.submit(make_request, base_url + "/" + line): line for line in lines}
                
                for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
                    url, status_code = future.result()
                    tqdm.write(f"{url} -> {status_code}")  # Use tqdm.write to avoid disrupting the progress bar
                    pbar.update(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code ensures that the progress bar remains in place while updating the status of each request. The [`tqdm.write`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fnapoleonsolo%2Fcyb_tools%2Fscripts%2Fpython%2Fdir_fuzzer.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%2240289db3-535d-4cd1-bef0-050d5bb303f9%22%5D "Go to definition") method is used to print the status, which keeps the progress bar from moving.

RageLessLion: how to display only the requests that gibve the 200 status code

GitHub Copilot: To display only the requests that return a 200 status code, you can add a conditional check before printing the status. Here's the updated code:

```python
import requests
import sys
import os
import concurrent.futures
import logging
from tqdm import tqdm

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename="dirbuster_errors.log", level=logging.ERROR)

# Custom headers
HEADERS = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DirBuster/1.0)"}

def make_request(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=5)
        return (url, response.status_code)
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        return (url, "Timeout")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Error for {url}: {e}")
        return (url, f"Error: {e}")

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: python3 path_finder.py <wordlist> <base_url>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    wordlist_path = sys.argv[1]
    base_url = sys.argv[2]

    if not os.path.isfile(wordlist_path):
        print(f"Error: File '{wordlist_path}' not found.")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    try:
        with open(wordlist_path, "r") as file:
            lines = [line.strip() for line in file if line.strip()]
        
        # Progress bar setup
        with tqdm(total=len(lines), desc="Scanning URLs") as pbar:
            with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
                futures = {executor.submit(make_request, base_url + "/" + line): line for line in lines}
                
                for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
                    url, status_code = future.result()
                    if status_code == 200:
                        tqdm.write(f"{url} -> {status_code}")  # Use tqdm.write to avoid disrupting the progress bar
                    pbar.update(1)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: An error occurred while processing the file: {e}")
        logging.error(f"File processing error: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code will only print the URLs that return a 200 status code, ensuring that the progress bar remains in place and is updated correctly.

RageLessLion: does not work 

GitHub Copilot: Let's ensure that the code correctly handles the status codes and updates the progress bar. Here's the revised code snippet:

```python
import requests
import sys

logging.basicConfig(filename="dirbuster_errors.log", level=logging.ERROR)

# Custom headers

def make_request(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=5)
        return (url, response.status_code)
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        return (url, "Timeout")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Error for {url}: {e}")
        return (url, f"Error: {e}")

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: python3 path_finder.py <wordlist> <base_url>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    wordlist_path = sys.argv[1]
    base_url = sys.argv[2]

    if not os.path.isfile(wordlist_path):
        print(f"Error: File '{wordlist_path}' not found.")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    try:
        with open(wordlist_path, "r") as file:
            lines = [line.strip() for line in file if line.strip()]
        
        # Progress bar setup
        with tqdm(total=len(lines), desc="Scanning URLs") as pbar:
            with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
                futures = {executor.submit(make_request, base_url + "/" + line): line for line in lines}
                
                for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
                    url, status_code = future.result()
                    if status_code == 200:
                        tqdm.write(f"{url} -> {status_code}")  # Use tqdm.write to avoid disrupting the progress bar
                    pbar.update(1)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: An error occurred while processing the file: {e}")
        logging.error(f"File processing error: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Make sure to check the following:
1. The [`make_request`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fnapoleonsolo%2Fcyb_tools%2Fscripts%2Fpython%2Fdir_fuzzer.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A42%2C%22character%22%3A43%7D%7D%5D%2C%2267d971ac-3e34-4d75-9be1-84d44c291a4d%22%5D "Go to definition") function correctly returns the status code.
2. The [`main`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fnapoleonsolo%2Fcyb_tools%2Fscripts%2Fpython%2Fdir_fuzzer.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A23%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%2267d971ac-3e34-4d75-9be1-84d44c291a4d%22%5D "Go to definition") function correctly processes the wordlist and base URL.
3. The progress bar updates correctly, and only URLs with a 200 status code are printed.

If the issue persists, please provide more details about the error or unexpected behavior you're encountering.

RageLessLion: make a README for the code

GitHub Copilot: Here's a README for your 

path_finder.py

 script:

# Path Finder



path_finder.py

 is a Python script designed to scan a list of paths (provided in a wordlist file) against a base URL to identify which paths return a 200 status code. This can be useful for directory busting or finding valid endpoints on a web server.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [`requests`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fnapoleonsolo%2Fcyb_tools%2Fscripts%2Fpython%2Fpath_finder.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A19%2C%22character%22%3A11%7D%7D%5D%2C%22518332dc-fa53-4a83-a572-874849654638%22%5D "Go to definition") library
- [`tqdm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fnapoleonsolo%2Fcyb_tools%2Fscripts%2Fpython%2Fpath_finder.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22518332dc-fa53-4a83-a572-874849654638%22%5D "Go to definition") library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install requests tqdm
```

## Usage

```sh
python path_finder.py <wordlist> <base_url>
```

- `<wordlist>`: Path to the wordlist file containing the paths to be scanned.
- `<base_url>`: The base URL to scan the paths against.

### Example

```sh
python path_finder.py wordlist.txt http://example.com
```

## Description

The script performs the following steps:

1. Reads the wordlist file and strips any empty lines.
2. Uses a thread pool to concurrently send HTTP GET requests to the base URL appended with each path from the wordlist.
3. Displays a progress bar using [`tqdm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fnapoleonsolo%2Fcyb_tools%2Fscripts%2Fpython%2Fpath_finder.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22518332dc-fa53-4a83-a572-874849654638%22%5D "Go to definition") to show the scanning progress.
4. Prints only the URLs that return a 200 status code.

## Logging

Errors encountered during the requests are logged to a file named `dirbuster_errors.log`.

## Code Overview

```python
import requests
import sys
import os
import concurrent.futures
import logging
from tqdm import tqdm

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename="dirbuster_errors.log", level=logging.ERROR)

# Custom headers
HEADERS = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DirBuster/1.0)"}

def make_request(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=5)
        return (url, response.status_code)
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        return (url, "Timeout")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Error for {url}: {e}")
        return (url, f"Error: {e}")

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: python path_finder.py <wordlist> <base_url>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    wordlist_path = sys.argv[1]
    base_url = sys.argv[2]

    if not os.path.isfile(wordlist_path):
        print(f"Error: File '{wordlist_path}' not found.")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    try:
        with open(wordlist_path, "r") as file:
            lines = [line.strip() for line in file if line.strip()]
        
        # Progress bar setup
        with tqdm(total=len(lines), desc="Scanning URLs") as pbar:
            with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
                futures = {executor.submit(make_request, base_url + line): line for line in lines}
                
                for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
                    url, status_code = future.result()
                    if status_code == 200:
                        tqdm.write(f"{url} -> {status_code}")
                    pbar.update(1)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: An error occurred while processing the file: {e}")
        logging.error(f"File processing error: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
